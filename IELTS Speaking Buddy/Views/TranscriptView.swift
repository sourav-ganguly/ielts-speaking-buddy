Here are the grammar errors found in your transcript:

1. "My name of my hometown is Bakun" should be "The name of my hometown is Bakun."
2. "this is a beautiful place" should be "It is a beautiful place." (to avoid starting multiple sentences in the same way).
3. "the area is located within the division of Bhel" should be "the area is located in the division of Bhel." (use 'in' for location).
4. "this is not a village this is more like a small town" should be "This is not a village; it is more like a small town." (use 'it' for clarity and separate independent clauses).
5. "but there is no traffic jam there is there a lot of trees" should be "but there are no traffic jams, and there are a lot of trees." (use 'are' with plural 'jams' and correct structure).
6. "and we have a beautiful river" is somewhat redundant after previous sentences; consider rephrasing it for clarity by connecting it better.
